# Analyze_Your_Runkeeper_Fitness_Data
The project is all about analysis of Individuals running activities dataset which is obtained by GPS Fitness tracker ‘Runkeeper’ for years to see how the individual was doing. So here we need to export past historical (7- years of) time-series data of running activities from the Runkeeper Smartphone app and identify trends, some facts and some potential problems.

In this project I’ll import ‘cardioActivites.csv’ data which was exported from the Runkeeper smartphone app. After importing I have created, imported, cleaned, and analyzed my data to answer the below questions. 

  •	How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
  
  •	Have I succeeded with my training goals?
  
  •	Am I progressing?
  
  •	What were my best achievements?
  
  •	How do I perform compared to others?
  
  •	and Some Fun facts.
